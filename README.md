## üîç Problem Statement

Currently, there is no standardized solution within our bank to monitor earnings releases and news from other major financial institutions. This creates several challenges:

- **Siloed Information**: Employees needing competitive intelligence must conduct their own research
- **Inconsistent Coverage**: Different departments develop their own processes to extract content
- **Manual Effort**: Significant time spent manually reviewing lengthy regulatory filings
- **Delayed Insights**: Critical competitive information may be discovered too late for strategic action
- **Information Overload**: Difficulty separating signal from noise in the financial information landscape

The lack of a unified approach means valuable insights may be missed, duplicate efforts occur across teams, and strategic decision-making is hindered by information gaps.

## üí° Solution: BankPulse

BankPulse creates a standardized aggregation and extraction platform that all employees can access to obtain intelligence about competitor banks and industry trends.
