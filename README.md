# BankPulse: Financial Institution News Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

BankPulse is an AI-powered news aggregation and intelligence platform that monitors, analyzes, and summarizes financial news about major Canadian banks. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how we can leverage AI to transform raw financial disclosures into actionable intelligence for internal stakeholders.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Scrapes SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval) for official bank disclosures and releases
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses large language models to create concise, readable summaries of complex financial documents
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, tile-based design with filtering capabilities by institution
- **Daily/Weekly Digest**: Configurable delivery schedule for keeping teams informed

## Expansion Roadmap

- Integration with additional news sources beyond SEDAR
- Social media sentiment analysis (Reddit, Twitter, etc.)
- Trend detection and thematic analysis
- Competitive intelligence reporting
- Personalized alerts and notifications

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
- **Backend**: Python (for scraping and LLM integration)
- **AI Components**: Large Language Models for summarization and sentiment analysis
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB for flexible document storage

## Business Benefits

- **Competitive Intelligence**: Stay informed about competitors' strategic moves
- **Market Awareness**: Identify emerging trends and industry shifts early
- **Time Efficiency**: Replace manual monitoring with AI-powered analysis
- **Decision Support**: Provide condensed insights to inform strategic decisions

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: SEDAR integration and basic interface (current PoC)
2. **Phase 2**: Additional news sources and improved summarization
3. **Phase 3**: Social media sentiment and trend detection
4. **Phase 4**: Personalized delivery and advanced analytics
