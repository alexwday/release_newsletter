# BankPulse: AI-Driven Financial Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face a critical challenge: staying informed about competitors' activities and industry trends requires significant manual effort and often results in information overload. Key stakeholders at our bank need to:

1. **Track regulatory filings** and official announcements from other Canadian financial institutions
2. **Identify emerging trends** across the industry to inform strategic decisions
3. **Assess competitive positioning** based on announcements from other banks
4. **Filter signal from noise** in an increasingly complex information landscape

Currently, this process involves multiple teams manually monitoring SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval), news outlets, and financial reports - a time-consuming process that often results in delayed insights, missed opportunities, and inefficient use of analyst resources.

## Solution: BankPulse

BankPulse transforms how we monitor and analyze financial industry intelligence by leveraging AI to automate the collection, processing, and delivery of insights from competitors' disclosures and industry news.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Scrape SEDAR for official bank disclosures and extract key information
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Use large language models to:
  - Summarize complex financial documents into clear, concise insights
  - Extract key metrics and strategic initiatives from dense reports
  - Identify trends across multiple institutions
  - Assess potential business impact of announcements
  - Generate competitive intelligence reports
- **Priority-Based Intelligence**: Flag and highlight critical updates based on relevance and potential impact
- **Intuitive Interface**: Present information in a clean, tile-based design with filtering capabilities by institution, category, and priority
- **Customizable Delivery**: Configure daily/weekly digests tailored to different stakeholder groups

### Business Benefits

- **Enhanced Competitive Intelligence**: 
  - Reduce time-to-insight from days to hours
  - Ensure consistent monitoring of all competitors 
  - Identify strategic shifts earlier than current manual processes
- **Resource Optimization**: 
  - Reduce analyst hours spent on manual document review by 70%
  - Redirect analyst focus to strategic interpretation rather than information gathering
- **Decision Support**: 
  - Provide executives with timely, focused intelligence to inform strategic decisions
  - Include AI-generated context and implications alongside raw information
